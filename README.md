# Payment-API
API to process payments in Java

Project inspired by Wirecard Backend Challenge. Consists of an API to process payments, storing information in a MySQL database. My goal with this project was to better understand Spring ecosystem, together with good practices related to its use.

Technologies used: Spring Web, Spring Data JPA with Hibernate, Spring security, MySQL, Maven, Bean Validation with Hibernate

# üõ†Ô∏è How to run

* Download JDK (Java Development Kit)

* Download MySQL and Create a MySQL database

* Clone this repository

* Go to demo/src/main/resources

* Create a file named application.properties

* Inside application.properties, copy and paste the following code, filling in with your data

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:<port>/<databaseName>?useTimeZone=true&serverTimezone=UTC&autoReconnect=true

spring.datasource.username=<yourUser>

spring.datasource.password=<yourPassword>

spring.datasource.driverClassName=com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver

spring.datasource.testWhileIdle=true

spring.datasource.validationQuery=SELECT 1

spring.jpa.show-sql=true

spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update

spring.jpa.hibernate.naming-strategy=org.hibernate.cfg.ImprovedNamingStrategy

spring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLDialect

spring.sql.init.mode=ALWAYS

spring.datasource.data=data.sql

spring.jpa.defer-datasource-initialization=true
```
* Download Maven. Go to /demo and run `mvn clean install`

* Go to /demo/target. You will se demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar

* Run demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar with `java -jar demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar` and send your requests
